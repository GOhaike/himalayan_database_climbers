## Brief
 - In mountaineering, the death zone refers to altitudes above 8,000 m (26,000 ft) where the amount of oxygen is insufficient to sustain human life for an extended time span. There are a total of 14 mountains in the death zone (als known as the eight-thousanders) located in the Himalaya and Karakoram mountain ranges. Each year, climbers from all over the world are drawn to the beauty of eight-thousanders and venture into the death zone in attempts to summit the peaks. While many succeed and celebrate the triumph on the top of the world, some unfortunately never return and many more are injured or become ill during the expeditions.

## Research Questions
- Who are the people willing to risk their life venturing into the death zone?

## Data Sources
- The Himalayan Database is a compilation of records for all expeditions that have climbed in the Nepal   Himalaya. The database is based on the expedition archives of Elizabeth Hawley, a longtime journalist based in Kathmandu, and it is supplemented by information gathered from books, alpine journals and correspondence with Himalayan climbers.

 ## Findings
 
-  Europe has the highest number of eight-thousander climbers given its long history in mountaineering. Most climbers come from developed countries including Japan, Korea, and the US.
Nepal has the highest climber population because of the Sherpa mountaineers hired by the expedition teams. It is widely believed that most expeditions would otherwise not even be possible without the help of Sherpas.

- Most mountaineers drawn to the eight-thousanders are, in fact, not professional climbers. Physicians predictably top the list because all expeditions require at least one physician to accompany the teams. The high number of alpine guides can also be explained by the experienced guides and Sharpas hired by the expedition teams. The engineers and students that show up as the top occupations for both Mount Everest and other eight-thousanders. Students can be comprehended by the fact that climbing eight-thousanders require the top-notch physical conditions possessed by young people. Yet the appearance of engineers could be attributed spare cash and time.

- Mountaineering has historically been dominated by men: Only 1 out of 10 climbers were female between 1905 and 2019. However, there has been a rapid growth of female climbers since 1980 with identical age distributions between male and female climbers, further demonstrating that climbing ability varies by age, not by gender. In fact, the youngest climber to ascend Mount Everest is a female climber

- Age Is a Problem, Says Who?
The average age of climbers to the eight-thousanders has been increasing steadily since 1980. The trend is almost identical between Mount Everest and the other 15 eight-thousanders. Age is definitely not stopping mountaineers from venturing into the death zone. Don't let age stop you!
